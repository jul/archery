"""Soon will come sets of consistent adders/subber/muler/diver
grouped in a consistent set known as algebrae
all the combined traits will ensure consistant properties on :
- commutativity;
- associativity;
- distributivity;
- neutral element of addition & multiplication

Planned : 
Linear algebrae,
Hermitian Algebrae 
and so much more....
